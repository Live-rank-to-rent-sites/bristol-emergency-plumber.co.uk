        <h2>Expert Plumbers Across East Bristol</h2>
        <p>East Bristol represents some of the city's most diverse and dynamic neighbourhoods. From the multicultural hub of Easton to the suburban streets of Fishponds, from the valley communities of Speedwell to the edge-of-city expanses of Kingswood, this region demands plumbers who understand its variety.</p>

        <p>The housing stock in East Bristol tells the story of the city's industrial growth. Victorian workers' cottages in Easton and St George sit alongside 1930s semis in Fishponds and post-war developments in Kingswood. Each era brought different construction methods and plumbing systems—and different challenges for modern maintenance.</p>

        <h3>Areas We Cover in East Bristol</h3>
        <div class="areas-grid">
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Fishponds</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS16</p>
            <p>A busy suburban centre with excellent amenities. Properties range from Victorian terraces near Fishponds Road to 1930s semis and modern infill developments. The area's popularity with families means we frequently handle bathroom additions and heating upgrades for growing households.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Easton</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS5</p>
            <p>Bristol's most diverse neighbourhood, with Victorian terraces converted into flats and HMOs alongside family homes. Easton's bohemian character attracts creative renovations, and we're experienced in working with unusual layouts and eco-friendly plumbing solutions like rainwater harvesting.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Eastville &amp; Stapleton</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS5, BS16</p>
            <p>Residential areas bordering Eastville Park and the M32. A mix of Victorian, inter-war and post-war housing. Many properties here have original heating systems due for replacement. We offer competitive quotes for full system upgrades.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>St George &amp; Speedwell</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS5, BS15</p>
            <p>Traditional working-class communities with strong local identity. Compact Victorian and Edwardian terraces predominate, often with access challenges that require experienced plumbers. We're used to working in tight spaces and arranging work around narrow streets and limited parking.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Kingswood</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS15</p>
            <p>Straddling the Bristol/South Gloucestershire border, Kingswood offers more spacious properties at accessible prices. The area includes older cottages in the High Street conservation area and larger family homes in surrounding streets. We handle everything from listed building considerations to standard domestic work.</p>

        <h3>East Bristol Plumbing Challenges We Solve</h3>
        <p>Years of working across East Bristol have given us insight into the area's recurring issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HMO compliance in Easton:</strong> With many properties converted to houses in multiple occupation, we provide landlord services including gas safety certificates, fire valve installations, and multi-occupancy heating solutions.</li>
          <li><strong>Hard water in BS16:</strong> Fishponds and surrounding areas experience limescale buildup that affects boiler efficiency and appliance lifespan. We install water softeners and provide descaling services.</li>
          <li><strong>Victorian drainage in St George:</strong> Original clay pipes serving Victorian terraces are prone to root ingress and collapse. We offer CCTV surveys and no-dig repair solutions.</li>
          <li><strong>Access challenges:</strong> Many East Bristol streets have limited parking and narrow rear access. Our plumbers are equipped with portable tools and experienced in carrying materials through houses when necessary.</li>
        </ul>
