        <h2>Period Property Plumbing Specialists</h2>
        <p>West Bristol contains some of the most architecturally significant properties in the city. From the Georgian grandeur of Royal York Crescent to the Victorian elegance of Redland's avenues, these historic buildings require plumbers who understand their unique demands. Our team specialises in working with period properties while respecting their heritage and character.</p>

        <p>The properties in West Bristol often present challenges you won't find elsewhere: original lead pipework that needs careful replacement, gravity-fed hot water systems in buildings where installing a combi boiler would be impractical, and drainage systems dating back 150 years or more. We have the expertise to navigate these complexities while providing modern reliability.</p>

        <h3>Areas We Cover in West Bristol</h3>
        <div class="areas-grid">
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Clifton &amp; Clifton Village</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS8</p>
            <p>Bristol's most prestigious address, featuring Grade I and Grade II listed Georgian townhouses, Victorian villas, and the iconic Clifton Suspension Bridge. Many properties have been converted into flats, creating complex shared plumbing arrangements. We're experienced in working within listed building constraints and liaising with conservation officers when required.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Hotwells</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS8</p>
            <p>A characterful neighbourhood tucked beneath Clifton, with Georgian and Victorian properties overlooking the Floating Harbour. The area's unique topography—properties built into the hillside—creates unusual plumbing configurations. We're familiar with the challenges of gravity systems on steep sites and pump installations for basement flats.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Redland</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS6</p>
            <p>Leafy residential streets lined with substantial Victorian and Edwardian homes. Many properties feature original features including high ceilings, bay windows, and period bathrooms. We balance modern plumbing requirements with sympathetic restoration, maintaining character while improving functionality.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Cotham &amp; Kingsdown</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS6, BS2</p>
            <p>A mix of Georgian townhouses, Victorian terraces, and student accommodation near the university. We provide services ranging from high-end renovations in owner-occupied homes to efficient HMO maintenance for landlords with student properties.</p>
          </div>

        <h3>Working with Listed Buildings</h3>
        <p>West Bristol has one of the highest concentrations of listed buildings in the UK outside London. We understand the additional considerations this brings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conservation compliance:</strong> We know when listed building consent is required and can advise on sympathetic solutions that satisfy both building regulations and conservation requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Hidden pipework:</strong> In listed buildings, visible modern pipework can be problematic. We specialise in discreet installations that minimise visual impact.</li>
          <li><strong>Original features:</strong> From Victorian cast iron baths to Edwardian sanitaryware, we can repair and restore original bathroom fittings rather than replacing them.</li>
          <li><strong>Specialist materials:</strong> Lead pipe replacement in listed buildings often requires copper rather than plastic to maintain authenticity. We use appropriate materials for each property.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Issues in West Bristol Period Properties</h3>
        <p>Our extensive experience in West Bristol has taught us what to expect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lead pipe replacement:</strong> Many pre-1970 properties still have lead supply pipes. We offer full and partial lead replacement services with minimal disruption.</li>
          <li><strong>Low pressure on upper floors:</strong> Tall Georgian townhouses often struggle with water pressure on higher floors. We install boosted systems designed for multi-storey period properties.</li>
          <li><strong>Outdated heating:</strong> Gravity-fed heating systems and back boilers are common. We can upgrade these to modern sealed systems while preserving original radiators.</li>
          <li><strong>Complex drainage:</strong> Properties converted into flats often have convoluted shared drainage. We provide CCTV surveys and clear documentation of drainage responsibilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>High-End Bathroom Installations</h3>
        <p>West Bristol residents often seek bathroom renovations that combine period authenticity with contemporary comfort. We work with premium brands and specialist heritage bathroom suppliers to create spaces that honour a building's character while providing modern functionality. Our portfolio includes freestanding roll-top baths, exposed pipe shower installations, and bespoke vanity solutions for period properties.</p>
