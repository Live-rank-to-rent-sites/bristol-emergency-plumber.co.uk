        <h2>Your Local North Bristol Plumbing Experts</h2>
        <p>North Bristol presents unique plumbing challenges that require local expertise. From the 1930s semi-detached homes of Horfield and Bishopston to the newer developments in Bradley Stoke, our plumbers understand the distinct characteristics of properties across this diverse region.</p>

        <p>The area's housing stock spans nearly a century of construction methods. Horfield's tree-lined streets feature substantial inter-war properties with original lead pipework and gravity-fed heating systems. Bishopston's Edwardian and Victorian terraces often have complex layouts created through conversions. Meanwhile, Bradley Stoke's modern estates have their own considerations, including plastic pipework and combination boilers that require different expertise.</p>

        <h3>Areas We Cover in North Bristol</h3>
        <div class="areas-grid">
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Horfield &amp; Bishopston</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS7</p>
            <p>These established residential areas feature predominantly 1920s-1940s housing. Common issues include ageing copper pipework, outdated stop valves, and heating systems that benefit from powerflushing. Many properties have had loft conversions requiring upgraded water pressure solutions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Filton &amp; Southmead</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS34, BS10</p>
            <p>A mix of social housing, ex-council properties, and private developments. We regularly work with housing associations and landlords in these areas. Common work includes boiler replacements, bathroom modernisations, and resolving issues in properties with shared drainage systems.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Henleaze &amp; Westbury-on-Trym</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS9</p>
            <p>Affluent areas with larger detached and semi-detached properties. Many homes have multiple bathrooms, unvented hot water systems, and underfloor heating. We're experienced with high-end bathroom installations and complex heating configurations common in these properties.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="area-card">
            <h4>Bradley Stoke</h4>
            <p>Postcodes: BS32</p>
            <p>Bristol's largest new-build area, developed primarily from the 1980s onwards. Properties typically have modern plastic plumbing and combi boilers. Common issues include boiler breakdowns, leaking flexi-hoses, and drainage problems in newer developments.</p>

        <h3>Common Plumbing Issues in North Bristol</h3>
        <p>Through years of serving North Bristol, we've identified several recurring issues specific to this area:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Low water pressure in BS7:</strong> Many Horfield and Bishopston properties suffer from inadequate mains pressure, particularly those on higher ground. We install pressure boosting systems and advise on unvented cylinder upgrades.</li>
          <li><strong>Frozen pipes in exposed properties:</strong> Larger detached homes in Henleaze and Westbury often have pipes running through unheated spaces. We provide pipe lagging and trace heating solutions.</li>
          <li><strong>Blocked drains from tree roots:</strong> The mature trees that make North Bristol so attractive can wreak havoc on drainage systems. We offer CCTV surveys and root cutting services.</li>
          <li><strong>Boiler issues in Bradley Stoke:</strong> Many original boilers installed in 1990s Bradley Stoke properties are now reaching end-of-life. We specialise in like-for-like replacements and system upgrades.</li>
        </ul>
