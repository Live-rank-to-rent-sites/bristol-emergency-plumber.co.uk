        <h2>Professional Drain Clearance in Bristol</h2>
        <p>Blocked drains are among the most unpleasant plumbing problems homeowners face. From slow-draining sinks to completely blocked toilets and sewage backups, drainage issues can quickly escalate from inconvenient to genuinely distressing. Our specialist drainage team provides comprehensive blocked drain services throughout Bristol, using advanced equipment to clear even the most stubborn blockages. Our <a href="/about">experienced, fully insured team</a> takes pride in delivering professional results on every job.</p>

        <p>We've invested in state-of-the-art drainage technology, including high-pressure water jetting equipment and CCTV drain survey cameras. This equipment allows us to diagnose problems accurately, clear blockages effectively, and identify any underlying issues that might cause future problems.</p>

        <h3>Types of Drain Blockages We Clear</h3>
        <p>Our drainage specialists handle all types of blockages, from simple domestic issues to complex commercial drainage problems:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Blocked Toilets:</strong> One of the most common and urgent drainage issues. Whether caused by excessive paper, foreign objects, or problems further down the line, we can clear blocked toilets quickly and hygienically.</li>
          <li><strong>Kitchen Sink Blockages:</strong> Grease, food particles, and soap scum accumulate over time, eventually causing complete blockages. Our high-pressure jetting cuts through these deposits effectively.</li>
          <li><strong>Bathroom Drain Blockages:</strong> Hair, soap residue, and cosmetic products combine to form stubborn blockages in shower drains and bathroom sinks.</li>
          <li><strong>External Drain Blockages:</strong> Leaves, debris, tree roots, and ground settlement can all cause external drains to block, potentially leading to flooding. If flooding is already underway, call our <a href="/emergency-plumber-bristol">emergency plumber</a> immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Main Sewer Blockages:</strong> Problems with your main sewer line affect all drainage in your property and require prompt professional attention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Drain Clearance Methods</h3>
        <p><strong>High-Pressure Water Jetting:</strong> Our primary method for clearing blockages involves using high-pressure water jets that can cut through the toughest obstructions. This method is highly effective against grease buildup, tree roots, and accumulated debris, while being safe for your pipes.</p>

        <p><strong>CCTV Drain Surveys:</strong> When the cause of drainage problems isn't immediately apparent, we use specialised cameras to inspect your drains internally. This allows us to identify the exact location and nature of blockages, collapsed sections, root intrusion, or other damage.</p>

        <p><strong>Mechanical Rodding:</strong> For certain types of blockages, traditional mechanical rodding remains effective. Our drainage specialists select the most appropriate method based on the specific situation.</p>

        <h2>Emergency Drain Clearance</h2>
        <p>Some drain blockages simply cannot wait until morning. When sewage is backing up into your property or flooding is occurring, you need immediate professional help.

Our <a href="/24-hour-plumber-bristol">24-hour plumbing team</a> can attend to urgent drainage problems at any time of day or night.</p>

        <h3>Preventing Future Blockages</h3>
        <p>While we're always here to help when blockages occur, prevention is better than cure. Here are some steps you can take to reduce the likelihood of drain blockages:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Never pour cooking oil or grease down the sink</li>
          <li>Use drain guards to catch hair in bathroom drains</li>
          <li>Avoid flushing anything other than toilet paper</li>
          <li>Regularly clean drain covers and remove debris</li>
          <li>Consider periodic professional drain cleaning to prevent buildup</li>
        </ul>
